                        Hi there, my name is Dat Nguyen and I'm currently a junior student at The University of Minnesota, twin-cities. My current main focus is front-end development but I also want to dive deeper into the back-end site and eventually become a full-stack engineer in the future.

                        Something about me is that i really enjoy coding and making fun stuff from it. I love the feeling that you can literally create everything you want with just a computer. Besides this, I also love Data Structure && Algorithms and I know this is a weird hobby but I enjoy solving LeetCode during my free time. I don't know but I always want to be better at DSA and that is also the reason I create my own data structure vizualization.
                    </p>

                        Are you still here? Then, i also enjoy playing basketball during my free time. Thank you so much for reading all of this and i appreciate that. I hope you have a great day!
