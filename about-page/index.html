                    My current main focus is front-end development but i also want to dive deeper into the back-end site and eventually become a

                    Something about me is that i really enjoy coding, like i'm deadly in love with coding and making fun stuff from it.
                    I love the feeling where you can literally create everything you want with just a computer. Beside this, i also love Data Structure && Algorithm and i know this 
                    is a weird hobby but i enjoy solving LeetCode during my free time. I don't know but for somehow i just want to be better at DSA and that is also the reason why my first project is Simple DSA.
